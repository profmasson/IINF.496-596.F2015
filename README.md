Fall 2015, Informatics 496/596: Principles and Practices of Open Source Software Communities

This is the community source for the University at Albany's Informatics (IINF) 496-596 course. IINF.496-596 is an introduction to the principles and practices of open source software communities. It is organized into three major areas of study: historical context and impact; community models and infrastructure, and; contemporary adoption and landscape. The course begins with a historical survey for the emergence of open source software as a development and economic model, clarifying the apparent contradictions between the free flow of information and funding / compensation of participants. The social and behavioral aspects of open source communities are covered to help understand the motivations that drive participants, and to become familiar with the mechanisms that can be used to encourage and foster active participation. Finally, the course will expose students to the use of open source software development across industries and even how the open source ethos is impacting fields of endeavor outside software and technology.
